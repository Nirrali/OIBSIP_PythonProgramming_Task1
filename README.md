# OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_Task1
A Python-based BMI Calculator that computes Body Mass Index and categorizes health status.
# ⚖️ BMI Calculator

## 🔹 Objective  
To build a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight, and categorizes health status accordingly.  

## 🔹 Steps Performed  
- Took user input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).  
- Applied the formula: **BMI = weight / (height²)**.  
- Categorized results into ranges:  
  - Underweight (BMI < 18.5)  
  - Normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25)  
  - Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30)  
  - Obese (BMI ≥ 30)  
- Displayed the BMI value (rounded to 2 decimals) and category.  

## 🔹 Tools Used  
- Python (CLI-based program)  

## 🔹 Outcome  
✅ A functional BMI calculator that helps users quickly determine their BMI and understand their health category.
